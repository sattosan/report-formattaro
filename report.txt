Computer viruses are a significant threat to network envi
ronments. System administrators of networks often find it
challenging to rapidly respond to Such a threat to the network.
For example, although a single infected computer may be
purged of the virus, a system administrator may find that the
computer virus may infect various computers in the network
for an extended period of time so long as there remains at least
one infected computer in the network. In the meantime, the
system administrator is often required to try to track down the
virus to determine which computer in the network is repeat edly infecting and clogging up the network. This process is
typically time consuming and expensive.
What is needed is a technique for tracking computer infec
tions.
